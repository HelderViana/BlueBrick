; This file handle the change in the part library in case of some part may be renamed
; The format of the file is quite simple:
; - if the line start with a semi-colon it is ignored (it is just a comment)
; - then every line has the form: <old name>=<new name>

; remaping of parts released in a previous version of BlueBrick
; and that were renamed because the made a mistake about the name (part id)
; this remaping should never be deleted to be able to load a very old version of a BBM file
