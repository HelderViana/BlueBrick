<P>BlueBrick was designed to facilitate the navigation on the <A HREF="Window_Panes.htm">Layout pane</A> especially if you have a mouse with 2 buttons and a wheel (but of course it is still possible to use BlueBrick on a laptop with a touchpad). In this section you can learn how to <A HREF="Zooming_and_Viewing.htm">zoom and pane the view</A>, and how to <A HREF="Selecting_Parts.htm">select parts</A>.</P>
