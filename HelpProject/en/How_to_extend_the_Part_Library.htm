<H1>How to extend the Part Library</H1>
<P>One of the strongest point of BlueBrick is its facility to extend the part library. Basically the Part Library is created when the application start up by parsing the files present on your hard-drive. Adding or removing parts is as simple as adding or removing files in the parts folder. If you want to know how to create and add your own parts to BlueBrick, You should follow these steps:</P>
