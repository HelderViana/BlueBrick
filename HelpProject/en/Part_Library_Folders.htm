<H1>Part Library Folders</H1>
<H2>Folder Organisation</H2>
<P>The part library is made of <A HREF="Part_Image_Format.htm">GIF format images</A> and <A HREF="Part_XML_Description.htm">XML files</A> all stored inside the subfolder named "parts" of the BlueBrick installation folder.</P>

<CENTER>
<DIV STYLE="background-image:url(../parts_folder.png); width:455px; height:331px; margin:0px;">
<DIV STYLE="height:162px; margin:0px;">&nbsp;</DIV><BR>
<DIV STYLE="color:red; text-align:left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2190; This is the part library folder.</DIV>
</DIV>
</CENTER>

<P>This folder is parsed when the application is launched and is needed for BlueBrick to run. You can create as many subfolders as you want in the "parts" folder, but <FONT CLASS="Important">only one depth level is supported</FONT>. Parts placed in folders within a subfolder will be ignored. Parts which are placed directly in the "parts" folder will also be ignored.</P>
 
<DIV class="TechNote">
<PRE><B>The original organisation of the "parts" folder is:</B>
parts
  &#x251C;&#x2500; Baseplate
  &#x251C;&#x2500; Custom
  &#x251C;&#x2500; Duplo
  &#x251C;&#x2500; Logo
  &#x251C;&#x2500; Rail
  &#x251C;&#x2500; Road
  &#x2514;&#x2500; Set

<B>And here is an example of modification of the parts folder:</B>
parts<FONT COLOR=red>    &#x2190; If you add parts in this folder they will be ignored</FONT>
  &#x251C;&#x2500; Baseplate
  &#x2502;<FONT COLOR=red>  &#x2514;&#x2500; My Baseplate    &#x2190; This folder will be ignored</FONT>
  &#x251C;&#x2500; Custom
  &#x251C;&#x2500; Duplo
  &#x251C;&#x2500; Logo
<FONT COLOR=green>  &#x251C;&#x2500; My Parts    &#x2190; This folder is ok</FONT>
  &#x251C;&#x2500; Rail
  &#x251C;&#x2500; Road
  &#x2514;&#x2500; Set</PRE>
</DIV>

<H2>BlueBrick folder parsing</H2>
<P>For each subfolder of the "parts" folder, BlueBrick will create a Tab page in the parts panel. The name of the Tab page is the same as the folder. You can choose any folder name and include space and accentuated characters. You can also rename, delete or reorganize the original folders as you like as they are not used to identify the parts. The folders are just a convenient container to group the parts together in different Tab Pages in the Brick library. The downside is that <FONT CLASS="Important">every part name in the whole library must be unique</FONT>, and the part name is the id that is saved in the map file. Usually this is not a big problem since every Lego&copy; part already has a unique number.</P>

<P>BlueBrick only looks for the GIF files in the parts folders when creating the parts library. For each GIF file that is found, BlueBrick then checks if an XML file of the same name exists. XML files are optional. An XML file without an associated GIF file will be ignored.</P>
