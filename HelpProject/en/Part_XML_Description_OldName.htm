	<TD>By default the &lt;OldNameList&gt; tag should be absent, which means that the part was never renamed.</TD>

	<TD CLASS="Tilte">Description:</TD>
	<TD>This tag is only usefull if you rename a part (change the GIF and XML file names) to still be able to load BBM files that were saved with the previous name.</TD>
</TR>  
</TABLE>

<P>Since the part numbers are saved in the BBM files (the layout file) as an id to list all the parts used in the layout, if you rename a part and try to load an old layout file, BlueBrick will not find the parts you have renamed and will display them as a red cross image. To avoid this problem you should add a <FONT CLASS="Important">OldNameList field</FONT> in the XML file.</P>

<P>Since a part can be renamed several times, you can add all the previous name of the part inside the <FONT CLASS="Important">OldNameList field</FONT>. This field contains a list of <FONT CLASS="Important">OldName field</FONT> and the content of this field is the full previous BlueBrick number (part number followed by a dot and by the color number).</P>

<P>Of course you only need to add this field if you already have publish your part on internet and that some people may have created some layout with the previous name of your part. By respect for them, you should then add the <FONT CLASS="Important">OldNameList field</FONT> such as they can reload their previous Layout. But if you are just experimenting localy the part creation you don't need to keep a full track of your renaming work.</P>

<P>Note that if you load a layout file with an old name and save it again, the new name will be used during the save. Nevertheless you should never delete a <FONT CLASS="Important">OldNameList field</FONT> unless you are certaint that all the layout files which were using the old name were converted. But since this feature does not overload too much BlueBrick, you can leave them forever, just in case.</P>

<P>You can also use the <FONT CLASS="Important">OldNameList field</FONT> as an alias for the part because actually BlueBrick is treating the previous names as alias. However if you add in the brick library a part that as the same name as a previous part that you have renamed, the alias for this renamed part will be ignored. Which means that BlueBrick only create the alias if there is not another part with the same name.</P>
